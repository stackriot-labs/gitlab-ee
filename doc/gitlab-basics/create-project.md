# How to create a project in GitLab

There are two ways to create a new project in GitLab.

1. While in your dashboard, you can create a new project using the **New project**
   green button or you can use the cross icon in the upper right corner next to
   your avatar which is always visible.

1. From there you can see several options.

1. Fill out the information:

  1. "Project name" is the name of your project (you can't use special characters,
     but you can use spaces, hyphens, underscores or even emojis).
  1. The "Project description" is optional and will be shown in your project's
     dashboard so others can briefly understand what your project is about.
  1. Select a [visibility level](../public_access/public_access.md).
  1. You can also [import your existing projects](../workflow/importing/README.md).

1. Finally, click **Create project**.
